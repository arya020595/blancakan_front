# Authentication File Organization Refactor

## Problem Identified

The file `src/hooks/use-auth-protection.tsx` was misnamed and contained mixed responsibilities:

### Issues:

1. **Wrong Extension**: `.tsx` should be `.ts` for hooks without JSX
2. **Mixed Responsibilities**:
   - Custom hook (`useAuthProtection`)
   - Higher-Order Component (`withAuthProtection`)
   - React components (`AuthLoadingScreen`, `AuthRedirectScreen`)
3. **Poor Organization**: All different types of code in one file

## Solution: Proper Separation of Concerns

### New File Structure:

```
src/
├── hooks/
│   └── use-auth-protection.ts           # ✅ Pure hook (no JSX)
└── components/
    └── auth/
        ├── index.ts                     # ✅ Auth components exports
        ├── auth-loading-screens.tsx     # ✅ Loading/redirect screens
        └── with-auth-protection.tsx     # ✅ HOC wrapper
```

### What Each File Contains:

#### `src/hooks/use-auth-protection.ts`

- **ONLY** the `useAuthProtection` hook
- Pure TypeScript (no JSX)
- Handles authentication state logic
- Returns authentication status and loading states

#### `src/components/auth/auth-loading-screens.tsx`

- `AuthLoadingScreen` component
- `AuthRedirectScreen` component
- Pure UI components for authentication states

#### `src/components/auth/with-auth-protection.tsx`

- `withAuthProtection` Higher-Order Component
- Wraps components with authentication protection
- Uses the hook and loading screens

#### `src/components/auth/index.ts`

- Central export point for auth components
- Clean imports for consumers

## Benefits of This Organization:

### ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle**

- Each file has one clear purpose
- Easier to maintain and test

### ✅ **Proper File Extensions**

- `.ts` for hooks (no JSX)
- `.tsx` for components (with JSX)

### ✅ **Better Developer Experience**

- Clear separation between logic and UI
- Easier to find and modify specific functionality

### ✅ **Consistent Architecture**

- Follows React/Next.js best practices
- Aligns with component organization patterns

### ✅ **Reusability**

- Hook can be used independently
- Components can be used separately
- HOC provides convenient wrapper

## Migration Impact:

- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ All existing imports still work
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Runtime functionality preserved

This refactor demonstrates proper React/Next.js project organization and separation of concerns.
