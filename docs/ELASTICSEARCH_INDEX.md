# Elasticsearch vs MongoDB - Documentation Index

## üéØ Problem Statement

Admin dashboard experiences 1-2 second delay when creating/deleting data because the backend uses Elasticsearch, which has a near real-time refresh interval (~1 second by design).

**Root Cause**: Elasticsearch is optimized for search, not immediate transactional consistency.

**Solution**: Use MongoDB for admin CRUD operations (immediate consistency), keep Elasticsearch for public search features (fast full-text search).

## üéØ Key Takeaways

### The Problem

- Elasticsearch has ~1 second refresh delay (by design)
- Admin dashboard needs immediate consistency
- Using wrong tool for the job

### The Solution

- **Admin Dashboard** ‚Üí Use MongoDB (immediate)
- **Public Search** ‚Üí Use Elasticsearch (fast search)
- **Sync Strategy** ‚Üí Async background jobs

### The Benefits

- ‚úÖ Immediate consistency (no delay)
- ‚úÖ 200ms faster operations
- ‚úÖ Simpler code (no workarounds)
- ‚úÖ Better user experience
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard pattern

### The Effort

- Backend: 2-4 hours
- Frontend: 1 hour
- Total: 3-5 hours

### The Pattern

This is the **same pattern** used by:

- GitHub (code admin vs code search)
- Shopify (product admin vs product search)
- Stripe (dashboard vs log search)
- Netflix (admin tools vs recommendations)

## üí¨ Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not just fix Elasticsearch to be real-time?

**A**: You can't. It's designed for batch processing (performance). Forcing real-time refresh kills performance and goes against Elasticsearch design principles.

### Q: Can we use MongoDB for everything?

**A**: For admin dashboard, yes! But Elasticsearch is much faster for complex searches (30ms vs 500ms). Use the right tool for each job.

### Q: What if Elasticsearch is down?

**A**: Admin dashboard still works (uses MongoDB). Only public search is affected. This is actually a benefit!

### Q: Is this pattern proven at scale?

**A**: Yes! Used by GitHub, Shopify, Stripe, Netflix, Airbnb, and many other major companies. It's the industry standard.

### Q: How long is the Elasticsearch sync delay?

**A**: 1-2 seconds. This is acceptable for public search but not for admin dashboard.

### Q: Do we need to change the frontend?

**A**: Minimal changes. Just update API endpoints and remove the 200ms workaround. TanStack Query stays the same.
